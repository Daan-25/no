# Epstein Satire Site

Static one-page website (HTML/CSS/JS) in English.

## Run on Ubuntu

From this folder:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then open:

- http://localhost:8080

## Deploy on Pages

Because this is a static site, you can publish it directly with any Pages host
that serves `index.html` from the project root.
