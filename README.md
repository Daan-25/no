# SATIRE MODE: ON

## Jeffrey Epstein: The Dumpster Fire Biography

A one-page dark comedy site in plain `HTML + CSS + JS`.
No frameworks. No build tools. No PR spin doctor.

## What this is

- A satirical roast page about power abuse, corruption, and elite nonsense.
- Interactive bits included:
- `Red Flag Checklist` counter
- `Conspiracy One-Liner Generator`
- Scroll reveal animations

## Run on Ubuntu

From the project folder:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Open:

- http://localhost:8080

If your browser says "this is cursed," that means it's working.

## Disclaimer

This project is satire. The jokes target abuse of power and systemic enabling,
not victims.
